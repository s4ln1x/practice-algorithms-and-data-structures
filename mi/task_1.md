# Task 1

Write a function solution that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns alphabetically the smallest string that can be obtained by removing exactly one letter from S.

Example:

1. Given S = "abc" the function should return "ab" since is alphabetically smaller than "ac" and "bc"
2. Given S = "hot" the function should return "ho" since is alphabetically smaller than "ht" and "ot"
3. Given S = "codibility" the function should return "cdility"
4. Given S = "aaaa" the function should return "aaa" any occurrence of "a" can be removed
